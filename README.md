# Reward Management App
This application was inspired by a personal experience. At an event I attended, rewards were claimed by presenting a piece of paper marked with a "P." Unfortunately, this allowed people to easily replicate the paper and claim rewards without actually participating in the event's activities. The purpose of this application is to prevent this kind of misuse by the audience, providing a more secure yet quick way to claim rewards.
